`insilico` is a Computational Neuroscience simulation library written in C++. `insilico` encourages ready-to-start approach for quick setup of simulation environment, without hindering programmers time and focus from intended experiment.

Library homepage: http://www.iiserpune.ac.in/~collins/insilico/

Install
=======

Please refer to `doc/INSTALL` file.

Build
=====
Clone the source and run the following commands on terminal.
```
   g++ -Wall -std=c++11  -I ./include -o insilico.out TH_network_mAch.cpp
```
use flag `-Ofast` to speed up simulation (no inaccuracies noticed)

Execute
=======

Run the python script `gen_nsets_Ca_N.py` to generate the different neuron configuration files

Run the following command on terminal to execute the code.
```
  insilico.out -o <output_file>.csv -n <neuron_file.isf> -s <synapse_file.isf> -t <time>

  Options:
    -o   Output file
    -n   Neuron configuration file
    -s   Synapse configuration file (ssets.isf)
    -t   simulation time in milliseconds (set to 15000 for 15 second simulations)

```
Please read `doc/FILES` file for details about the input and output files and their formats.
